Norad is the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation. We function as an administrative and specialist body supporting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Climate and the Environment. Our work is grounded in achieving Norwegian development policy goals, promoting sustainable development, and is guided by the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), climate goals, and human rights. We are based in Oslo and have around 320 dedicated employees.

## Our focus: Digitalization for development

We believe that digital solutions are powerful catalysts for social, economic, and democratic progress globally. A key part of Norwegian development aid focuses on:

* Protecting private data and freedom of expression.
* Upholding human rights in the digital sphere.
* Ensuring access to fundamental social services digitally.

We champion **Digital Public Goods (DPGs)** – open-source software, data, AI systems, and content – and **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)** as vital tools for digital transformation, especially when implemented safely and sustainably.

Why? Because billions still lack internet access or digital identification, hindering access to essential services. Well-implemented DPGs and DPI can:

* Foster efficient, inclusive systems.
* Drive innovation in public and private sectors.
* Increase equality and protect individual rights (e.g., access to education, healthcare, finance).
* Contribute significantly to economic growth and achieving the SDGs.

Norway, alongside partners like the [Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA)](https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/map) (which we co-founded), [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.no/), and [UNDP](https://www.undp.org/), plays a leading role in promoting DPGs and DPI. We have supported key initiatives like [DHIS2](https://dhis2.org/), the [Global Digital Library](https://digitallibrary.io/), [MOSIP](https://www.mosip.io/), [OpenCRVS](https://www.opencrvs.org/), and are part of the [50-in-5 campaign](https://50in5.net/).
